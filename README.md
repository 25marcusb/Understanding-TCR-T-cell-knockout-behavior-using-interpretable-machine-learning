This Github Repo contains the files used to train the model and generate the GradCAM images used in "Understanding TCR T cell knockout behavior using interpretable machine learning"
The files will not run if they don't have the raw data in the same folder. This data has not been released yet, but it will be coming out soon alongside a future paper released by the Engelhardt Lab.
